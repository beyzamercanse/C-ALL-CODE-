Falling Distance

The following formula can be used to determine the distance an object falls due to 
gravity in a specific time period:

	d = 1/2gt^2

The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8,
and t is the time in seconds that the object has been falling.

Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in
seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that
the object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates
the function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as
arguments, and displays the return value.
