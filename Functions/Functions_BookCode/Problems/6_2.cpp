/*
Celsius Temperature Table
The formula for converting a Temperature from Fahrenheit to celsius is

 	C = (5 * (F - 32))/9

where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature.
Write a function named celsius that accepts a Fahrenheit temperature as an
argument. The function should return the temperature, converted to Celsius.
Demonstrate the function by calling it in a loop that displays a table of the
Fahrenheit temperatures 0 through 20 and their Celsius equivalents.
