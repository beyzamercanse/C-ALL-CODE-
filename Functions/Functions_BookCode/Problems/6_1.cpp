/*
1st problem
Write a program that asks the user to enter item's wholesale cost and its markup
percentage. It should then display the item's retail price.  For example:

	* If an item's wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 100%. then
	  the item's retail price is 10.00.
	* If an item's wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 50%. then
	  the item's retail price is 7.50.

The program should have a function named calculateRetail that receives the wholesale
cost and the markup percentage as arguments, and returns the retail price of the item.

	  Input Validation: Do not accept negative values ofr either the wholesale cost
	  of the item or the percent markup.
